## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Wine Red (#8B0000), evocative of the rich wine culture.
- Background color: Aged Parchment (#F5F5DC), reminiscent of historical documents and tradition.
- Accent color: Dark Olive Green (#556B2F), complementing the primary hue, creating contrast, and echoing natural elements like olive groves.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for an elegant and high-end feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, to ensure readability and modernity. These two fonts pair well.
- Employ minimalist icons with an artisanal inspiration to enhance the visual experience without overwhelming the user.
- Utilize a fluid, spaced editorial layout with gentle carousels and asymmetrical grids to evoke a magazine-like feel rather than a catalog or corporate dashboard.
